# Udacity-Page-A-B-Testing

In this case study, you’ll analyze the A/B test results for Audacity. Here's the customer funnel for typical new users on their site:

View home page > Explore courses > View course overview page > Enroll in course > Complete course

Audacity loses users as they go down the stages of this funnel, with only a few making it to the end. To increase student engagement, Audacity is performing A/B tests to try out changes that will hopefully increase conversion rates from one stage to the next.

We’ll analyze test results for two changes they have in mind and then make a recommendation on whether they should launch each change.
